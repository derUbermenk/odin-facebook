The features currently implemented are friends and friend requests, post creation and editing. post liking, comments, and sharing. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i><br>
Post sharing is currently undergoing rework due to it being initially being treated as an attachment, such was planned to handle both video and photo uploads in the feature. The main branch remains to use the initial implementation of post shares however, and work is being in done on a separate branch to mitigate the possibility of a failed design choice.
